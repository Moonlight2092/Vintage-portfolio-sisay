            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio . I am a passionate computer science student with a deep love for design, technology, and creativity.
                . as a computer science student, i am fascinated by how algorthims shape the world around us- how they are the silent
                architects of everything from social media to scientific discovery.i prefer my algorthims like my coffee strong,efficient,and with no errors.
                technology evolves,but the principles of problem-solving and logical thinking remain timeless. i am on a journey to not
                only master code but also to understand the fundamental processes that drive progress. currently upgrading my brain to
                version 2.0,one algorithm at a time.
